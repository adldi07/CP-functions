# CP Functions Repository

This repository is designed to store general-purpose functions and templates for Competitive Programming (CP). Currently, it includes a binary search implementation, with plans to add more functions in the future.

## Features
- **Binary Search**: A function to perform binary search on a sorted array.
- Future additions: More commonly used algorithms and utilities will be added over time.

## File Structure
- `binarysearch.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the binary search function.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Use the provided functions in your CP solutions:
   - For binary search, include `binarysearch.cpp` in your project.
3. Compile and run your code:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 <filename>.cpp -o <output>
   ./<output>
   ```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! You can add new functions, optimize existing ones, or improve documentation. Please ensure your code is well-documented and adheres to competitive programming standards.
